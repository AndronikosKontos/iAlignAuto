# iAlignAuto

1) Run ialign_call.py to align the target protein (e.g 1r0r) to the library
2) Run ialign_output.py to create the dataframe and export it to csv

The file "ial_out1.txt" already contains the output of iAlign, so step 1 can be skipped.

list.lst -> contains the names of the pdb files that will be aligned with the target protein
target.lst -> contais the name of the target protein

In order to run ialign_call.py you need to have the library of the proteins on your computer and change the directories in the Bash Command.
